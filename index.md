### Hello World!
So a little bit about me before I start to go into more in depth stuff, I'm a student at the University of Alaska Fairbanks. 
The place where it frequently gets below 0 degrees in the winter and then makes the summers seem way too hot for living. I'm studying
Computer Science, which has always been a passion of mine since I was little, messing with computers (and sometimes breaking them, but it 
was never my fault). One of the most noteable things that I've done in the past year is that I participated in a hackathon hosted through
the Univeristy of Alaska Fairbanks, Cyber Security Club. In it me and my team won judges choice for "Most Alaskan" and our project was
a bluetooth proximity door lock, it was a daunting task, but ended up being incredibly fun. You can find the webpage for the event [here](https://www.csc.uaf.edu/hackathon/).
