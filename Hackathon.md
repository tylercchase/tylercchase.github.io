### UAF Hackathon
A Hackathon is an event where people gather around, for hours upon hours and slave away trying to complete a project aching to be completed within the time constraints imposed by the hackathon. It sounds stressful, and it was stressful at the time, but looking back it was completely worth it. I learned so much during those days, that I was forced to learn to be able to complete a part of the project I was working on with my team it.
